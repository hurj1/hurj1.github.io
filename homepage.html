        <h1 style="font-family:cursive;">Welcome to my Webpage</h1>
        
    <p>  
       I created this website to help my promote myself for future employers. 
        I started my college career at a commununity college called Middlesex County College 
        and proud to say I currently have an Associates Degree in Psychology. Psychology was so 
        interesting because I loved learning how the brain works in all ages. As I was doing my research,there 
        weren't very much jobs out at there unless if you went through medical schools to open up your own practice. 
        That wasn't for me and really had to think of an back up of what I want to do. I didn't want to go through
         medical feid which made me change my mind what I wanted my future career would be.</p>

        As I transfered into Kean University, I had to make a decision and finally made a decision to pursue a 
        Bachelors Degree in Information Technology and mainly focusing in Security. I currently work as a technician 
        and really enjoy what I'm doing. My goal is to pursue on what I love to do and potentially pass it down as 
        technology is growing all around the world. I didn't think I would enjoy tech this much until I got hands on 
        experience. Growing up I was surrounded with different technologies which help me get into it. I'm proud to 
        say I will be graduating Spring 2023 and can't wait what my future will hold.
